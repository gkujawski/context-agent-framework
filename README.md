# **Context Agent Framework for LLM Applications**

This repository outlines a generic "Context Agent" framework designed for building robust Large Language Model (LLM) applications. Inspired by the concept of "context engineering" (as opposed to mere "prompt engineering"), this framework emphasizes the strategic assembly of diverse information within an LLM's context window to optimize performance, relevance, and cost-efficiency.

## **Introduction**

In the evolving landscape of LLM applications, simply providing a "prompt" is often insufficient for complex, real-world use cases. The true power lies in "context engineering" – the deliberate and intelligent process of populating the LLM's context window with precisely the right information. This framework provides a structured approach to this critical task, ensuring the LLM has all the necessary context to perform optimally, while managing token limits and costs.  
This framework is particularly relevant for applications requiring:

* Personalization  
* Access to real-time data  
* Complex multi-turn conversations  
* Tool utilization  
* Consistent and reliable output formats

## **The Context Agent Framework**

The "Context Agent" framework decomposes the LLM's input context into several distinct, yet interconnected, components. These components are dynamically assembled for each LLM inference call.

### **1\. Instructions / System Prompt**

**Purpose:** Defines the LLM's core identity, persona, overarching objectives, and fundamental behavioral rules. This is the foundational layer guiding the agent's general conduct.  
**Content Examples:**

* "You are a helpful and concise technical assistant."  
* "Your primary goal is to assist users in debugging Python code."  
* "Always adhere to ethical AI guidelines; do not invent facts."  
* Few-shot examples demonstrating desired input-output patterns.

### **2\. Long-Term Memory**

**Purpose:** Provides persistent knowledge, learned user preferences, summaries of past projects, or facts the agent has been told to remember across multiple conversations or sessions.  
**Content Examples:**

* "User prefers short, bulleted summaries."  
* "Summary of 'Project Alpha': Main goal was X, current status Y, key decisions Z."  
* "The user's preferred programming language is Python."

### **3\. Retrieved Information (RAG)**

**Purpose:** Injects dynamic, up-to-date, and highly relevant external knowledge into the context, grounding the LLM's responses in factual data and overcoming its knowledge cut-off.  
**Content Examples:**

* Results from database queries (e.g., product inventory, user details).  
* Responses from external APIs (e.g., weather, stock prices, internal service data).  
* Relevant passages from a corpus of documents (e.g., internal wikis, manuals) retrieved via semantic search.  
* Summarized web search results.

### **4\. State / History (Short-term Memory)**

**Purpose:** Maintains coherence and context within the ongoing dialogue, allowing the LLM to understand the flow and nuances of the current conversation.  
**Content Examples:**

* The last N user queries and the corresponding model responses.  
* Intermediate flags or variables set during the current interaction (e.g., user\_confirmed\_payment: true).

### **5\. Available Tools**

**Purpose:** Extends the LLM's capabilities by defining functions it can call to interact with external systems, fetch real-time data, or perform specific operations.  
**Content Examples:**

* JSON Schema definitions for functions like check\_inventory(productId: string) or send\_email(recipient: string, subject: string, body: string).

### **6\. User Prompt**

**Purpose:** The immediate task, question, or instruction provided by the user for the current turn of the conversation.  
**Content Example:**

* "My order \#12345 hasn't arrived yet. Can you check its status?"

### **7\. Structured Output**

**Purpose:** Defines the desired format for the LLM's response, ensuring it adheres to a specific, machine-readable structure (e.g., JSON, XML). This is crucial for downstream processing and integration.  
**Content Examples:**

* A JSON Schema defining the expected fields and their types for the model's response.  
* Instructions like: "Your response \*must\* be a JSON object with the keys 'status' and 'message'."

## **Implementation with Google Cloud Tools**

This framework is designed to be highly compatible with Google Cloud's AI and data services, enabling robust and scalable LLM applications.

* **LLM Inference:** **Gemini API (via Vertex AI)** for powerful and flexible model interaction, including function calling and structured output.  
* **System Prompt/Configuration:** **NotebookLM** for drafting and iterating on prompt versions, or simply stored in **Cloud Storage** or a configuration service.  
* **Long-Term Memory:**  
  * **Firestore / Cloud Spanner:** For structured user preferences, project summaries, and learned facts.  
  * **Cloud Storage \+ Vertex AI Embedding API \+ Vertex AI Vector Search:** For storing and retrieving vector embeddings of documents and more amorphous knowledge bases.  
* **Retrieved Information (RAG):**  
  * **Vertex AI Search:** For building comprehensive RAG pipelines that ingest data from various sources (websites, documents, databases) and perform semantic search.  
  * **Cloud Functions / App Engine / Cloud Run:** To host backend logic for database queries, external API calls, and orchestrating retrieval processes.  
* **State / History (Short-term Memory):**  
  * **Firestore / Cloud Datastore:** For storing conversational history for each user session.  
* **Available Tools:**  
  * **Vertex AI Function Calling:** Gemini models natively support function calling, where the LLM can intelligently decide to invoke predefined tools.  
  * **Cloud Functions / Cloud Run:** To implement the actual backend logic for the tools (e.g., check\_inventory would be a Cloud Function).  
* **Orchestration Logic:** Typically implemented in **Python (using the Gemini SDK)** or Node.js, deployed on **Cloud Run** or **App Engine**, which acts as the "Context Agent" assembling all the pieces before sending to the LLM.
